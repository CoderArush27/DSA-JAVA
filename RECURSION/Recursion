when a function calls itself inside a function it is known as rescursive function and the process is known as recursion

Base condition to stop a recursion otherwise stack overflow

In recursion there are both ascending phase and descending phase and this the major difference between a loop and recursion

Statements before the recursive function call executes during ascending phase and statements after the recursive function call executes during descending phase

Recursion uses stack to maintain its activation record
